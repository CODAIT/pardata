Schema File Format
==================

A schema is a tree-like data structure that describes a dataset or a format, or a license. It contains information such
as the download URL, license, format descriptions of a dataset. We usually represent them in the yaml format, or as a
Python ``dict`` in a Python program.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: <dataset name>
   published: <published date>
   homepage: <homepage URL>
   download_url: <download URL>
   sha512sum: <sha512sum of the dataset file>
   license: <SPDX license token or custom license symbol>
   estimated_size: <estimated size>
   description: <description>
   subdatasets:
     <subdataset1_id>:
       <Dictionary that describes the subdataset>
     <subdataset2_id>:
       <Dictionary that describes the subdataset>
     ...

Below is an example schema that describes the
`IBM Debater速 Thematic Clustering of Sentences <https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/thematic-clustering-of-sentences/>`_
dataset:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: IBM Debater速 Thematic Clustering of Sentences
   published: 2019-08-01
   homepage: https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/thematic-clustering-of-sentences/
   download_url: https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-thematic-clustering-of-sentences/1.0.2/thematic-clustering-of-sentences.tar.gz

   subdatasets:
     full:
       name: IBM Debater速 Thematic Clustering of Sentences
       description: IBM Debater速 Thematic Clustering of Sentences complete dataset
       format:
         id: table/csv
         options:
           columns:
             article_title: 'string'
             sentence: 'string'
             cluster_title: 'string'
             article_link: 'string'
       path: dataset.csv

A schema file is a yaml file that gathers multiple schemata. It can be seen as representing a dataset repository. These
schemata may be gathered together because they are within the same community, share the same ownership, or for any other
reasons. It is typically structured as

.. code-block:: yaml

   api_name: com.ibm.pardata.v1
   name: <Identifier of the schema file>
   last_updated: <ISO date string of last update>
   datasets:
     <dataset1_id>:
       <version1>:
         <the schema of dataset1_id version1>
       <version2>:
         <the schema of dataset1_id version2>
       ...
     <dataset2_id>:
       <version1>:
         <the schema of dataset2_id version1>
       <version2>:
         <the schema of dataset2_id version2>
       ...
